## 📊 Evals & AI Quality

How to define "good" for an AI feature — the PM's job, not the ML engineer's.

- **[Anthropic's Guide to Evals](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/develop-tests)** — How to build test suites for LLM applications. The starting point.
- **[AI Evals Course on Maven](https://bit.ly/aievals-ph)** — Practical eval design for PMs. Highly recommended.
- **[promptfoo/promptfoo](https://github.com/promptfoo/promptfoo)** ⭐ 16k — Evals + red-teaming framework PMs can use as a release gate. Runs prompt comparisons and catches regressions.
- **[confident-ai/deepeval](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval)** ⭐ 14k — Straightforward framework for building LLM evaluation suites. Good starting point for PM-led eval programs.
- **[Arize-ai/phoenix](https://github.com/Arize-ai/phoenix)** ⭐ 8.8k — Observability + eval workflows for production AI features. Useful for ongoing quality monitoring.
- **[truera/trulens](https://github.com/truera/trulens)** ⭐ 3.1k — Feedback and eval instrumentation for LLM systems.
- **[langfuse/langfuse](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse)** ⭐ 23.3k — Open-source observability, evals, prompt management, and datasets. Good PM pick because it makes quality review and regression tracking visible beyond raw logs.
- **[Helicone/helicone](https://github.com/Helicone/helicone)** ⭐ 5.3k — LLM observability plus experimentation. Useful for PMs who want to compare prompts, models, and live behavior without building custom dashboards first.
- **[tensorzero/tensorzero](https://github.com/tensorzero/tensorzero)** ⭐ 11.1k — Gateway plus observability, optimization, and evaluation in one stack. Strong addition for PMs thinking about production quality and experimentation together.
- **[vibrantlabsai/ragas](https://github.com/vibrantlabsai/ragas)** ⭐ 13.0k — Evaluation toolkit for LLM and RAG systems. Helpful when PMs need a more structured quality conversation than "the outputs seem better."
- **[guardrails-ai/guardrails](https://github.com/guardrails-ai/guardrails)** ⭐ 6.5k — Guardrail layer for LLM applications. Good PM resource for trust-sensitive workflows where failure handling matters as much as model performance.
- **[comet-ml/opik](https://github.com/comet-ml/opik)** ⭐ 18.3k — Open-source AI observability, evaluation, and optimization. Strong PM pick when you want traces, evals, and prompt iteration in one system instead of separate tools.
- **[Giskard-AI/giskard-oss](https://github.com/Giskard-AI/giskard-oss)** ⭐ 5.1k — AI testing framework focused on performance, bias, and security risk. Useful when PMs need a more explicit trust and red-team conversation before rollout.
- **[Agenta-AI/agenta](https://github.com/Agenta-AI/agenta)** ⭐ 3.9k — Open-source LLMOps stack for prompt management, evaluation, and observability. Good fit for teams graduating from ad hoc prompt tests into repeatable experimentation.
- **Key PM mental model:** Define your eval criteria *before* you build. "The AI should sound like a human" is not an eval. "95% of outputs score ≥4/5 on our rubric" is.

## 🏗️ Building AI Products

Patterns, frameworks, and hard-won lessons from PMs who ship AI features.

- **[Vibe Coding vs. Vibe Engineering](https://www.productcompass.pm/p/vibe-coding-vs-vibe-engineering)** — Important distinction: vibe coding is prototyping; vibe engineering is production. Know which one you're doing.
- **[The PM's Guide to RAG](https://www.productcompass.pm/p/how-to-build-a-rag-chatbot)** — When to use RAG vs fine-tuning vs prompt engineering, explained for PMs.
- **[Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps](https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps)** — Working code examples for LLM applications. Clone → run. Great for PMs who want to understand by doing.
- **[humanlayer/12-factor-agents](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents)** ⭐ 18.8k — Production principles for LLM-powered software. Strong fit for PMs and founders because it sharpens architecture judgment without feeling like an ML textbook.

### Key architectural decisions PMs own
| Decision | What to consider |
|----------|-----------------|
| RAG vs fine-tuning | RAG for dynamic/private data; fine-tuning for consistent tone/style |
| Model choice | Cost/latency/capability triangle — don't default to the biggest model |
| Streaming vs batch | User experience decision first, then engineering |
| Memory architecture | Session vs persistent vs none — depends on your trust model |

---

## 💰 LLM Economics for PMs

Cost and latency are product decisions. PMs need to own them.

- **[BerriAI/litellm](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm)** ⭐ 39.3k — Model gateway with cost tracking, routing, logging, and guardrails. Very relevant for PMs making cost-versus-quality decisions across providers.
- **[Portkey-AI/gateway](https://github.com/Portkey-AI/gateway)** ⭐ 10.9k — AI gateway with routing and integrated guardrails. Useful for PMs who need reliability, fallback logic, and vendor flexibility built into product decisions.
- **Token pricing reference:** [Anthropic pricing](https://www.anthropic.com/pricing) · [OpenAI pricing](https://openai.com/api/pricing) · [Google pricing](https://ai.google.dev/pricing)
- **Mental model:** Input tokens are cheap. Output tokens cost 3-5x more. Design your prompts accordingly.
- **Haiku/Flash for high-volume, low-stakes tasks. Sonnet/Pro for core reasoning. Opus/Ultra for one-shot complex analysis.**
- **Caching:** If your system prompt is long and reused, prompt caching can cut costs 80-90%.
